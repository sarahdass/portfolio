                <p>I was the lead of a group for this detective game that I did in one of my video game classes. 
                    I made the interaction system, many assets (character art, clue art, some 3D models, 
                    book art for journal), and did some level editing.</p>
                <p>In this game, the player is a detective working for King Arthur. His sword is 
                    missing and it is up to the player to determine what happened. Players collect 
                    clues and interview witnesses (or suspects) to help make their decision. There are 
                    two modes in this game: the first person 3D map and the journal.</p>
                <p>Physical clue collection is done in the 3D map. Players can simply walk around and click
                     on clues to collect them. There are some clues that unlock tracking--visible footprints 
                     that lead to another clue, particularly in areas the player may not have thought of 
                     looking. This tracking can also show that some clues are connected.</p>
                <p>There are three things that can be done in the journal: interview witnesses, 
                    look at discovered clues, and make a conclusion. Each of these has its own tab. 
                    To interview characters, the player will simply click on the Interviews tab, then 
                    the character that they wish to talk to. Players must be careful with their responses 
                    to certain characters, however. Some conversation paths will lead to more 
                    information given than others. The clues tab is there to help the player remember 
                    clues--physical or from interviews. The conclusion tab is for when the player is 
                    ready to form a conclusion. Once the player continues after the prompt, they cannot 
                    exit the journal and must complete the questions to win the game</p>
